    "# Service Desk Ticket Analysis Using Machine Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "Modern IT environments generate a high volume of service desk tickets daily, ranging from minor issues to critical incidents. Managing this flow efficiently is essential for maintaining service quality and ensuring rapid response. Traditional ITSM frameworks like ITIL provide structured processes, but as ticket volumes and complexity increase, manual handling leads to delays, misclassifications, and reduced customer satisfaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project explores how machine learning can be applied to service desk ticket analysis to enhance operational efficiency, improve accuracy, and embed predictive intelligence into IT service management workflows.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "The initiative focuses on four key areas where data-driven models can significantly improve service desk operations:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **High-Priority Ticket Prediction:** Build predictive models to identify tickets that are likely to escalate into Priority 1 or 2 incidents, allowing teams to act proactively and minimize impact.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Incident Volume Forecasting:** Use historical time-based data to forecast ticket volumes quarterly and annually, supporting better resource planning and capacity management.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Automated Classification of Tickets:** Develop classifiers to automatically assign appropriate priority levels and departments, reducing delays caused by misrouted or miscategorized tickets.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **RFC and Misconfiguration Risk Prediction:** Predict the likelihood that a ticket will lead to a Request for Change (RFC) or result in a system misconfiguration, enabling smarter change control decisions.\n",
    "\n",
