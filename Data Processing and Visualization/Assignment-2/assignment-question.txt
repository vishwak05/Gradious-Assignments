Do all the data preprocessing steps that we have learnt:

1. Data loading
2. data cleaning
3. handling NULL Values
4. Creating / doing one-hot encoding
5. Feature engineering
6. Handling outliers
7. Creating few charts which tells us about the data. Like which features are important w.r.t target variable, etc.
8. Feature Reduction - zero variance and high correlation
