Anomaly Detection in Manufacturing Process Data

Objective: Use Isolation Forest to detect anomalies in manufacturing process data.
Dataset: Manufacturing Process Data for Predictive Maintenance

Tasks:
    1. Preprocess the data to handle missing values and normalize features.
    2. Train an Isolation Forest model to detect anomalies in the manufacturing process.
    3. Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics.
    4. Visualize the results to show normal vs. anomalous data points in the process.
    5. Discuss potential causes of anomalies and recommend actions for process improvement.

Submission Guidelines/Deliverables:
    A Jupyter notebook containing:
        - Code for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
        - Comments and explanations for each step.
        - Visualizations of the results.
    A PDF report summarizing the approach, findings, and recommendations for process improvement.
    A README file with instructions on how to run the notebook and any dependencies required.
