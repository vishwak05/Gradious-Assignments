# Duck Typing in Banking Domain

Duck typing is a programming concept where an object is choosed based on whether it has certain methods and properties or not, instead of the actual type of the object. It creates a structure or protocol for every other class to follow.

In python, it means an object is created with certain methods like execute and update_balances which are used again by different Transaction classes, without any need of inheritence.

## Benefits:

- **Flexibility:** Duck typing allows different transaction types (Deposit, Withdrawal, Transfer) to be used interchangeably as long as they implement the required methods(execute, update_balances).

- **Simplicity**: Developers can focus on object's functionality rather than implementation. This leads to less boilerplate code, as there is no need for explicit interfaces or abstract base classes.

- **Extensibility**: We can easily add new transaction types without modifying existing logic. This is made easy by simply creating methods with same names but with different functionality.

- **Interchangeability:** Transaction objects can be used interchangeably in functions and collections, which simplifies the code. This can be beneficial during testing.

## Limitations

- **Runtime Errors:** Since type checking happens at runtime, missing methods or incorrect signatures can cause errors only when the code is executed, not during development. It requires careful testing to avoid bugs.

- **Readability:** It may be unclear and harder what the methods are expecting and functionality for a given context, making it harder for new developers to understand or maintain the code.

- **Safety:** In domains like banking, where reliability and correctness are crucial, the lack of compile-time checks can be risky. Strict type checking and Static typing can catch certain errors earlier and provide more robustness.

## Summary

Duck typing offers powerful flexibility and rapid development benefits, especially in dynamic languages like Python. However, in the banking domain, where correctness and reliability are important, it should be used with caution. Combining duck typing with thorough unit testing and clear documentation can help mitigate some of its risks.
